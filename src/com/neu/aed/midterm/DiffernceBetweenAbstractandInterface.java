     *Q Differnece Between Abstract Class and Interface?
     *
     * Ans: Abstract Class
     * 1. Abstract class is a blueprint of a class, It is defined by abstract keyword.
     * 2. Abstract class can have multiple concrete methods(with implementation) but it should have at least one abstract method.
     * 3. Abstract methods doesn't have implementation.
     * 4. Object of Abstract class cannot be instantiated, but the class extended Abstract class can be instantiated.
     * 5. Class can not extends multiple abstract class.
     * 6. Abstract class can use in inheritance
     *
     * Interface
     *
     * 1. Interface is a blueprint of class, it is defined by interface keyword.
     * 2. Object of Interface class can't be instantiated, but the class implemented interface class can be instantiated.
     * 3. By default all the methods in interface are abstract. That means interface doesn't have concrete methods.(before java8)
     * 4. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
     * 5. Interface resolved the probleme of Multiple inheritance
