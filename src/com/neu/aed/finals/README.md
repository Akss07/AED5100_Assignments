Output: "a2b1c5a3"
```
```

Output: "ab"
```

 ## Question 3: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"

Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3

```

## Question 4: Given an integer n, return any array containing n unique integers such that they add up to 0.

```
Input: n = 5
Output: [-7,-1,1,3,4]
Explanation: These arrays also are accepted [-5,-1,1,2,3] , [-3,-1,2,-2,4].
```

```
Input: n = 3
Output: [-1,0,1]
```

## Question 5: Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

```aidl
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
```
```aidl
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
```
